Good Spirits is a drink tracking iOS app that helps you stay under government-suggested limits for "low-risk" drinking. Features charts and stats, the ability to pull your check-ins from Untappd, and the ability to sync your drinks as calories to HealthKit.

The source code is provided under the GPL license with absolutely no support or maintenance commitments. Please enjoy as an educational codebase or for personal use!

Compiling the code should be pretty straight-forward. Just make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` beforehand.
